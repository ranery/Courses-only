This is my code for the programming assignment of ¡¶Information Theory¡·Course£¡

All my code is based on Matlab.

Here is the configuration of these files:

	Project_info.m		---	Main program

	Huffman.m		---	Huffman Coding function

	Shannon.m		---	Shannon Coding function

	dec_to_bin.m		---	Covert decimal fraction to binary fraction

	Steve_Jobs_Speech.doc	---	Document that will be handled

	run_result.txt		---	The result of running Project_info.m

	Coding_Huffman.txt	---	The Document after Huffman Coding

	Coding_Shannon.txt	---	The Document after Shannon Coding

	Decoding_Huffman.txt	---	The Document recovered form Coding_Huffman.txt

	Decoding_Shannon.txt	---	The Document recovered form Coding_Shannon.txt

end

Note:	Please open '.txt' file in Matlab.
